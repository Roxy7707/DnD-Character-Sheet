Born of [[Dragons]], as their name proclaims, the [[Dragonborn]] walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the [[Dragons]] themselves, [[Dragonborn]] originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of [[Dragons]] and [[Humanoids]]. Some [[Dragonborn]] are faithful servants to true [[Dragons]], others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
