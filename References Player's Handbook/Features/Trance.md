Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The [[Common]] word for such meditation is "[[Trance]].") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a [[Human]] does from 8 hours of sleep.
