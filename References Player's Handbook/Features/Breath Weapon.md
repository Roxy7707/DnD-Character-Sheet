You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your [[Draconic Ancestry]] determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your [[Breath Weapon]], each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a [[Saving Throw]], the type of which is determined by your [[Draconic Ancestry]]. The DC for this [[Saving Throw]] equals 8 + your [[Constitution]] modifier + your [[Proficiency]] bonus. A creature takes 2[[d6]] damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.
The damage increases to
- 3[[d6]] at 6th level
- 4[[d6]] at 11th level
- 5[[d6]] at 16th level

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.
