**(TCE).** You learn one [[Maneuver]] of your choice from among those available to the [[Battle Master]] archetype. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a [[Saving Throw]] to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your [[Strength]] or [[Dexterity]] modifier (your choice.)
- You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.
